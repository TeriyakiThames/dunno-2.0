# Calculories Monorepo

A modern **pnpm + Turborepo** monorepo containing a web frontend, backend API, and shared packages. This setup is designed for **type safety**, **fast builds**, and **scalable collaboration**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Package Manager**: pnpm (workspace-based)
- **Monorepo Tooling**: Turborepo
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React
- **Backend**: Next.js
- **Language**: TypeScript

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm v10+

```powershell
npm install -g pnpm
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

From the repository root:

```powershell
pnpm install
```

> pnpm will install all workspace dependencies and link local packages automatically.

---

### 3️⃣ Run Applications

```powershell
pnpm dev
```

---

## 🔗 Shared Types Usage

Shared types live in:

```
packages/shared-types
```

They are consumed using workspace dependencies:

```ts
import type { User } from "@calculories/shared-types";
```

### Why this matters

- One source of truth for DTOs
- No duplicated types between frontend and backend
- End-to-end type safety

---

## ⚡ Turborepo

Turborepo handles:

- Incremental builds
- Task caching
- Dependency-aware pipelines

Example (from `turbo.json`):

- `web` depend on `shared-types#build`

---

## 🧹 Code Style & Formatting

- **Prettier** formats all files
- **ESLint** is configured per app
- Formatting is enforced via editor + CI (recommended)
